Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) -  05-Mar-2025 
-----------------------------------------------------------
SDLC is a step-by-step process to build software or applications. 

Phases of SDLC: 
---------------
Requirement Gathering: Collecting business needs from the customer. (Output: BRS - Business Requirements Specifications
Analysis & Planning: Understanding requirements, creating a project plan. (Output: SRS - System Requirements Specification, Project Plan) 
Design: Creating system architecture and component designs. (Output: Design Documents - HLD & LLD) 
Development/Coding: Writing code based on design. (Output: Code & Executable Software) 
Testing: Checking the software for bugs and ensuring it meets requirements. 
Deployment & Maintenance: Releasing software and fixing issues if needed. 

 

Waterfall Model 
----------------
Follows a step-by-step approach (one phase starts after the previous one finishes). 

Phases: 
-------
Requirement Gathering 

Design & Planning 
Coding 
Testing 
Deployment 
Maintenance 

------------
Drawbacks: 
------------
Not good for complex projects with frequent changes. 
Time-consuming. 
Hard to modify requirements once started. 
No working software until the last stage. 

 
----------------------
Agile Methodology 
-------------------
Faster & flexible development approach. 
Iterative (repeat process) and incremental (add features gradually). 
Projects are broken into small parts (iterations) of 2 to 8 weeks. 
After each iteration, a working product is delivered.
